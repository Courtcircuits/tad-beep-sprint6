##  How do I manage the authentication system with an OIDC ?
## Architecture
As defined in the previous question, Beep infrastructure will be as follows :

In a first time let's not focus on the "gateway" part of this infrastructure nor the data management but on the **authentication** and **identity management**.

## User creation
In a nutshell, user creation must go through three steps : 
1. Getting user data from the identity provider (either a registration form, polytech LDAP or a social media...)
2. Saving that data in the user service
3. Registering an identity in keycloak so later we can bind keycloak user identity to the user service
Though, we can use keycloak as an [identity broker](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html). An identity broker is a service that can be used to map a user identity from a service provider (e.g. Google) to another service (here Beep).
Keycloak bases identity providers on the following protocols:
- SAML v2.0
- Open ID Connect v1.0
- Oauth v2.0
