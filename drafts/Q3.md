## Needs (introduction)

### Communication between microservices

Beep services need to communicate with each other to exchange data. Developers must be able to iterate quickly between services and be able to test their changes without having to restart the whole application. This means that each service need to document very explicitely each of its endpoints.


### Service discovery

In a microservices architecture, services need to be able to discover each other. This is important because Beep services will be deployed on different servers and we need to be able to route requests to the right service. If a service is down, the rest of the infrastructure need to alert it to make sure that the error doesn't last for too long.

## Options 

### Communication protocols

In a distributed context, managing communication between microservices involves several key considerations. One of the first decisions to make is the protocol that will facilitate this communication. There are two primary options: REST API and gRPC. Each has its own advantages and trade-offs, and the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system.

### REST API

The REST API protocol is widely used for communication between microservices using HTTP requests. It leverages standard HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to define the type of request and the expected response. One of the significant advantages of REST is its simplicity and ubiquity. Most developers are familiar with HTTP and REST, making it easier to implement and maintain. Additionally, REST is stateless, which aligns well with the stateless nature of microservices.

Another benefit of REST is the ability to generate documentation and type-safe clients based on an API schema using OpenAPIv3. This can significantly improve developer productivity and ensure consistency across different services. Tools like Swagger can be used to generate interactive API documentation, which can be exposed via an endpoint such as `kubernetes.local/<my-service>/docs`. This documentation serves as a contract between services, clearly defining the expected inputs and outputs for each API endpoint.

However, REST was not originally designed with type safety in mind. While tools like OpenAPIv3 and Swagger can help mitigate this, they add an additional layer of complexity. The contract between services is defined in a file called `docs/openapi.yaml`, which is used to generate both the documentation and the client. This approach ensures that all services adhere to the same contract, reducing the risk of mismatches and errors.

### gRPC

gRPC is another protocol used for communication between microservices, leveraging the concept of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). It is a type-safe and battle-tested protocol that has been widely adopted in the industry. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) as its interface definition language (IDL), which allows for efficient serialization and deserialization of data. This makes gRPC particularly suitable for high-performance and low-latency applications.

One of the key advantages of gRPC is its type safety. The protocol ensures that the data types and structures are consistent across services, reducing the risk of errors and mismatches. Additionally, gRPC supports bi-directional streaming, which can be useful for real-time applications that require continuous data exchange.

gRPC also offers built-in support for code generation. The protocol definitions can be used to generate client and server code in multiple languages, ensuring consistency and reducing the amount of boilerplate code. This can significantly improve developer productivity and ensure that all services adhere to the same contract.

### Choosing Between REST and gRPC

While gRPC offers several advantages, such as type safety and performance, REST API with code generation can also be a viable option. Libraries like `Swaggo` in Golang can be used to generate documentation and clients from an OpenAPIv3 schema. This approach combines the simplicity and familiarity of REST with the benefits of type safety and code generation.

To implement this approach, each developer needs to define a contract for communicating with other services. This contract is defined in a file called `docs/openapi.yaml` and is used to generate both the documentation and the client. The documentation can be exposed using the `scalar` library, making it accessible via an endpoint like `kubernetes.local/<my-service>/docs`. This ensures that the API contract is easily accessible and understandable for all developers.

The client can be generated using the `swagger` library, which reads the OpenAPIv3 schema and produces type-safe client code. This ensures that all services adhere to the same contract, reducing the risk of errors and mismatches. Additionally, the `swaggo` library can be used to generate tests and mocks by providing examples within the OpenAPI file. This further enhances the reliability and robustness of the communication between microservices.

In conclusion, both REST and gRPC have their own strengths and trade-offs. While gRPC offers type safety and performance, REST API with code generation can provide a balance between simplicity and type safety. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system, as well as the preferences and expertise of the development team. By carefully defining the contract and leveraging tools for code generation and documentation, developers can ensure reliable and efficient communication between microservices in a distributed context.

### Using Istio for microservices communcation

Istio is a robust service mesh that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for managing microservices, including service discovery, traffic management, security, and observability. At its core, Istio leverages the Envoy proxy, which is deployed as a sidecar alongside each microservice. This sidecar handles all inbound and outbound traffic for the microservice, enabling a range of advanced networking features.

One of the key strengths of Istio is its ability to provide automatic service discovery. When a new service is deployed, Istio's Pilot component detects the service and updates its internal registry. This allows other services within the mesh to discover and communicate with the new service dynamically. The Pilot component manages and configures the Envoy proxies, ensuring that the service registry is always up-to-date. This automatic service discovery eliminates the need for manual intervention, making it easier to manage and scale microservices.

Istio also offers dynamic configuration capabilities. It uses a central configuration store, typically implemented with Kubernetes ConfigMaps or a similar mechanism, to dynamically update the service registry. This ensures that services can be added, removed, or updated seamlessly. For example, if a new version of a service is deployed, Istio can update the Envoy proxies with the new service information, allowing other services to discover and communicate with the updated service without any downtime.

In addition to service discovery, Istio provides advanced load balancing capabilities. It supports various load balancing algorithms, including round-robin, least-connections, and weighted load balancing. This ensures that traffic is evenly distributed across multiple instances of a service, improving performance and reliability. Istio's load balancing capabilities are particularly useful for handling high traffic loads and ensuring that no single instance of a service is overwhelmed.

Istio's traffic management features are another significant advantage. It offers fine-grained control over traffic routing, allowing for features like canary deployments, A/B testing, and traffic shifting. This is particularly useful for gradually rolling out new features or versions of a service. For example, a new version of a service can be deployed to a small subset of users initially, and if it performs well, the traffic can be gradually shifted to the new version. This helps in minimizing the risk of deploying new features and ensures a smooth transition.

Security is a critical aspect of any microservices architecture, and Istio provides robust security features. It offers mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between services, ensuring that data is encrypted in transit. Additionally, Istio provides role-based access control (RBAC) and other security features to ensure that only authorized services can communicate with each other. This helps in preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

Observability is another key strength of Istio. It integrates with monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to provide detailed metrics, logs, and traces. This helps in monitoring the health and performance of services and diagnosing issues. For example, if a service is experiencing high latency, Istio's observability features can help identify the root cause and take corrective actions.

In summary, Istio is a comprehensive service mesh that offers advanced service discovery capabilities, along with traffic management, security, and observability. By leveraging Istio, organizations can build scalable, secure, and highly available microservices architectures. Its automated management, dynamic configuration, and robust security features make it an ideal choice for managing complex microservices deployments.
