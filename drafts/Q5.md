## Q5: How can I trace logs and queries ?
## Needs (introduction)
In a distributed context, there are several prerogatives to tackle concerning observability through logs and traces.
First of all, logs must be standardized. If we want to be able to exploit throughout our system we need to define a standard for logging to make sure that logs can be processed the same way regardless on which service has emitted this log. Each log must contain a level of importance (for example : DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or ERROR), a time of emission. The log also provides a body that contains the log message. Finally to know where the log comes from, we need to add the name of the service that created that log + the ID of the container that issued that log. 
The goal of that data is to know when and in which context the issue occured in case of an incident.
Logs will be emitted by difference sources. For example, there will be two types of access logs, the one coming from the load balancer, by the service mesh and the one emitted by the application themselves. 
## Types of logs

As highlighted in the previous paragraph, logs will be emitted by difference sources therefore, the development team won't be able to standardize each time the log structure since this structure will depend on the log emitter.

But we can still define for now what is the format used for **application logging** (application logging encompasses all logs produced by a service coded by the development team).

```json
{
	""
}
```
### Access logs
### Audit logs
### Error logs
