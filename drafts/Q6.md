# Q6: Production ready system
## Available infrastructure
For Beep, we have nine servers available each with the same configuration.
- **CPU** : 2
- **RAM** : 64GB
- **Disks** : 
	- one SSD of 256GB
	- two disks of 1.2TB
## Volumetry estimation
**TO-DO** : based on the scenario detailled bellow, I need to estimate how many requests per seconds beep needs to furfil.
## Networking for high disponibility
## Load balancing
Istio is a service mesh that also provides a reverse proxy. [This benchmark](https://www.solo.io/blog/istio-grafana-k6) shows that Istio can server around 4000 requests per seconds on a 1 CPU server and this metric can go up to 25000 requests per seconds on a 8 cpus server.
**TO-DO :** load testing comparison between Istio and a classic traefik lb on the polytech network with the current beep stack as the example.
